  <b>News:</b> Every fifteen minutes we contact the <a href="https://newsriver.io/" target="_blank">NEWSRIVER API</a> - a free news provider service - and perform a full-text search for all item labels in several languages to see if any of the most revised Wikidata items in the previous hour were mentioned in the online news. We have to constrain the search window to every fifteen mintues because of the NEWSRIVER API constrains and fair use. Also, we have an opportunity to make 225 NEWSRIVER API calls in one search window so we need to constrain on the number of items and their labels that we search for. Currently, NEWSRIVER API does not search for news in Asia and Africa, so our search is constrained to the following languages: "en", "fr", "de", "ru", "es", "pt", and "it". We look for the news published on the day the item was revised in Wikidata and then in two previous days.<br>
  <b>Note.</b> No attempt is made to check for the relevance of any particular news article found for the Wikidata item at hand: if the <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Lucene</a> full-text search, running on the NEWSRIVER API back-end, finds a match - we report the article as potentialy relevant for an item. We plan to introduce a news relevance check service to this dashboard in the future. The <i>Entity</i> column lists all labels that were used to search for the respective Wikidata item.
